    <h3>About this test</h3>
    <p>
      The NEO Personality Inventory, authored by Paul T. Costa, Jr. and Robert
      R. McCrae, is one of the most widely used commercial inventories for
      measuring the five major domains (and facets of those domains) of
      personality. Decades of research support the reliability, validity, and
      utility of the scales of the NEO PI.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even though the NEO PI is one of the best available measures of normal
      personality, its commercial status creates several drawbacks for potential
      users. Cost can be a factor for those without funding. Copyright disallows
      administering a partial or edited version of the NEO PI, as well as
      presenting this inventory on the Web. The NEO PI-R® is copyrighted by
      Psychological Assessment Resources (PAR) in Florida, and can only be
      ordered by professionals and used by permission. The genuine NEO PI-R®
      (240 items) is considered by many psychologists to be the best inventory
      for measuring traits within the Five Factor Model (FFM) of personality.
    </p>
    <p>
      To overcome the drawbacks of the NEO PI (and other commercial personality
      inventories), Lewis R. Goldberg of the Oregon Research Institute (ORI)
      created a set of public domain items called the International Personality
      Item Pool (IPIP). By administering items from the IPIP along with the NEO
      PI and other commercial inventories to a community sample, ORI researchers
      were able to construct reliable scales that correlate strongly with scales
      from commercial inventories, including a 300-item analog for the NEO PI,
      or IPIP-NEO. Since the creation of the original IPIP-NEO, at least two
      120-item IPIP-NEO inventories have been created. The IPIP-NEO is not
      equivalent to the commercial inventory on which it is based.

      Responses from over 20,000 persons were used to insure that the short
      version possesses acceptable measurement reliability. Although the short
      version meets professional standards of reliability, the longer version is
      even more reliable. The short IPIP-NEO provides an alternative for persons
      who do not have time to complete the original inventory.

      A note on terminology: <em>personality traits</em> describe, relative to
      other people, the frequency or intensity of a person's feelings, thoughts,
      or behaviors.Possession of a trait is therefore a matter of degree. We
      might describe two individuals as extraverts, but still see one as more
      extroverted than the other. This report uses expressions such as
      'extrovert' or 'high in extraversion' to describe someone who is likely to
      be seen by others as relatively extroverted.
    </p>
    <p>
      The computer program that generates this report classifies you as low,
      average, or high in a trait according to whether your score is
      approximately in the lowest 30%, middle 40%, or highest 30% of scores
      obtained by people of your sex and roughly your age. Your numerical scores
      are reported and graphed as percentile estimates. For example, a score of
      '60' means that your level on that trait is estimated to be higher than
      60% of persons of your sex and age. Please keep in mind that 'low,'
      'average,' and 'high' scores on a personality test are neither absolutely
      good nor bad. A particular level on any trait will probably be neutral or
      irrelevant for a great many activities, be helpful for accomplishing some
      things, and detrimental for accomplishing other things.
    </p>
    <p>
      As with any personality inventory, scores and descriptions can only
      approximate an individual's actual personality. High and low score
      descriptions are usually accurate, but average scores close to the low or
      high boundaries might misclassify you as only average. On each set of six
      subdomain scales it is somewhat uncommon but certainly possible to score
      high in some of the subdomains and low in the others. In such cases more
      attention should be paid to the subdomain scores than to the broad domain
      score.
